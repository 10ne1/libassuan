* waitpid is used instead of pth_waitpid as well as some  other
  functions.
* When turning libassuan into a shared library, provide a general
  version as well as a Pth-enabled one.
* Need API documentation.
* assuan_transact returns immediately on an error in the callback
  function.  It might be better to return the error to the caller. As
  an example see dirmngr-client, where we need to send empty responses
  for unknown inquiries, albeit dirmngr itself would handle the
  returns for assuan_inquire gracefully.  We need to check all
  applications whether it is safe to change this.
* Check the system error to assuan error translation
* Do a configure test for SO_PEERCRED.
  We already use HAVE_SO_PEERCRED buty it never gets defined.
* Replace assuan_pipe_connect2 by  assuan_pipe_connect.
